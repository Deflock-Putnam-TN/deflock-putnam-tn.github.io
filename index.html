                  <li>"The searchable interface makes it <em>as easy to search for actionable evidence <strong>as it is to shop online</strong></em>"</li>
                  <li>"...you'll be able to see what time a potential suspect entered the neighborhood, how long they were inside, and what time they left"</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>These aren't just license plate cameras. They are a network of surveillance cameras that track everything about your car and, by nature, where you are and where you've been.</strong></p>

              <p>It's not just your local police department's network either--<strong>most Flock customers share their data with hundreds of other Flock customers.</strong></p>

              <ul>
                  <li>"You can't get a breath of air without us knowing", says a police officer in Colorado, harassing a woman at her home after her vehicle was merely spotted when she visited her tailor near the location of a crime.</li>
                  <li>"Flock's default agreement with police departments gives the company the right to share data with federal and local agencies for 'investigative purposes' even if a local department chooses to restrict data to its own officers." - <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-massachusetts-and-updates" target="_blank">ACLU</a></li>
                  <li>An officer in Manasha, Wisconsin used their Flock Safety system to stalk his ex-girlfriend.</li>
                  <li>Just look to our very recent Covid lockdowns on how this could be abused further. The government could have used this information to automatically flag, track, and possibly fine anyone for just leaving their home.</li>
                  <li>Putnam could enable a public "Transparency Portal" for their Flock Safety account that allows anyone to view basic audit information, but they haven't.</li>

              <h2>Flock is not secure</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>"Multiple Flock Safety accounts (I.e, the accounts for the cities and departments using these cameras) were found for sale on the Dark Web"</li>
                  <li>Researchers found that by pressing a button on the back of the camera in a certain pattern, you can enable a wifi connection that, with a bit more work, gives you complete access to the camera, camera software, and the data it is recording.</li>
                  <li>Researchers also found that you can isolate and decode the data stream from the camera's radio transmissions, which also gives you access to the data.</li>

          <section>
              <p>Our nation has become a mass surveillance state, and Flock Safety cameras are only furthering this problem. Flock Safety cameras enable the government to spy on people without reasonably suspecting them of having committed a crime.</p>

              <p>This is a violation of the 4th Amendment. Usually, for the government to invade a person's life, it requires a warrant. Now, there is no judicial oversight. At the click of a button, the government can know where you've been, and when.</p>

              <p>Mass surveillance of its own people is a power that the government should not have. You aren't a criminal, so why don't you care that the government is treating you like you might be one?</p>

                    <p>Vehicle Fingerprint — standard on all Flock LPR cameras — uses machine learning to analyze captured footage to identify key details that traditional LPR cameras can't, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make</li>
                        <li>Body type (sedan, SUV, pickup truck, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Color</li>
                        <li>Plate state</li>
                        <li>Resident or non-resident vehicle</li>
                        <li>Type of plate (standard vs. temporary)</li>
                        <li>Missing plate</li>
                        <li>Other identifiers (roof rack, window stickers, toolbox, and more)</li>

                    <h3>Carpenter v. United States (2018)</h3>
                    <p>In Carpenter v. United States (2018), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the argument that venturing into public eliminates Fourth Amendment protection. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the government's access to 127 days of cell-site location data; tracking movements on public roads; achieved <em>"near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone's user."</em> <a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Common_Questions,_Arguments,_%26_Responses_when_discussing_Flock_Surveillance#cite_note-:0-1" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
                    
                    <p>The Court said <em>"A person does not surrender all Fourth Amendment protection by venturing into the public sphere."</em></p>
